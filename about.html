            <img src="images/Super_Sonic_Acrobatic_Battle_Cars.jpg" alt="SARPBC">
            <p>In my free time I like to play video games or watch anime
                Right now I am working at Jerseys Mikes as a shift manger.
            </p>
            <h2>Anime</h2>
            <p>One of my faviorte anime to watch is Sword Art Online because it is about being trapped in an video game where your life is on the line.
                I also like Cyber Punk Edgerunners becuase I feel like it has a really good story and good pacing all put into only 10 episodes.
                The anime that has changed my perspective on life would most likly be vinland saga because they do a really good job at showing charcter development and how nice peace can be.
            </p>
            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I mainly like video games because they are fun to play and I get to meet alot of differnt people.
                One of my faviorte video games is Rocket League because I have been playing it for alomost a decade and I still have fun playing the game.
                I have meet alot of people on Rocket League that have beem my friends for many years and we still play video games together.
